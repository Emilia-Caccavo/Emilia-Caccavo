## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently learning github, working with packet tracer, linux, java, and python.  I've enjoyed java a lot.

I have hobbies outside of computers including sewing, writing, drawing, crocheting, and baking!

This is my dear sweet Esther :black_cat: :cat:: ![20240713_133217 (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/850d37c6-3a35-4536-9471-f3556c21bcdb)


Fun facts: I make plushies in my free time.  I love brownies and tiramisu. My favorite holidays are christmas and halloween.  My favorite singer is Hozier.
